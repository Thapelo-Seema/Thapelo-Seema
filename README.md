# Thapelo Seema 
I am a self-driven and passionate Software Developer. I am excited for the future of technology and I want to be involved in creating world-class software solutions as I also learn from others.

I am currently working on:
- Clickinn: A smart accommdation-rentals platform (Java Springboot, Angular and Ionic). I'm also looking into creating an AI model to assist with agent productivity on the platform.
- Geeks4Learning Geek Management System: A digital solution to automate tasks and processes involved in training software professionals.
